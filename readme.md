# KCVanilla Fork

This is a fork of KCVanilla that I used for a PR into that mod. This branch is specifically for some stuff that didn't get accepted but I like so keep around for my sake.

Not an ideal version for others to use. [Check out the actual mod here](https://github.com/kcgidw/kcvanilla).
